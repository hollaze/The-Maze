## My story

The Maze game has been done for the final project of the first year at Holberton School.

As a gamer, and developer, I want my future job to be a Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality game developer,
so making a game for my final project was an evidence for me.

I already got a little bit of knowledge about the Unity game engine and at first I wanted to do a game
on this engine, but, I told myself: "But how do you do a game without a game engine?".

#### **This is how The Maze started**

## What is The Maze

The Maze is a game in which the player spawn at the center of the map, and is locked
in a maze *(I had quite the inspiration for the project name right?)*, the player can try to find the exit *(but there is none, evil laught)*.

## Inspiration

The Maze project is a game directly inspired by a famous game: **Wolfeinstein3D**,
Wolfeinstein3D is a game made in 1992, developped by id Software, made without a game engine *(exactly what I needed, hallelujah)*.

## How to develop without a game engine

To make the game, I used the C language because i already knew some of it, *(I could have tried the C++)*
and the most important thing here was to find **the thing** to be able to do a game without a game engine,
this thing is the SDL library.

For this project, the SDL library was useful for creating a window, rendering things on the window like forms, colors, textures, and taking the user inputs.

## What I could have done more

- I could have implemented an exit to my labyrinth / EndGame
- I could have implemented objects
- I could have implemented enemies (Like Wolfeinstein3D) / gun in players hands
- I could have implemented rain

And so on, only imagination and skills can make it possible.
